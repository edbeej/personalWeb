<h3 align = "center" style = "margin-top:0;">E-learning Platform with Moodle</h3>
<p><b>The Problem: </b> Our instructors (including myself) were teaching our students by handing out PDFs for lessons and quizzing them with another PDF and an Excel to grade their work. Seemed very archaic and having an online solution would be best since we had students in different locations around the world.</p>
<p><b>The Solution: </b> Since we were dealing within a closed network we needed something open source. Moodle was the perfect candidate and rather easy to manipulate. Setting up was rather tedious since we had to ensure extra security measure for the network we were using. I also had to create new plugins for to tailor the teaching to a more aural type learning environment.</p>

<h3 align = "center">Time Keeping with PKIs</h3>
<p><b>The Problem: </b> We did not have a way to measure how long students were actively in our control or studying the material. We could measure their accomplishments by the tasks they finished online but we didn't know exactly how long they were studying since students could listen to audio locally. Initially the instructors had to "wing it" and guess how long the students were doing their work. How can we track the time students spent, especially on a closed network? </p>
<p><b>The Solution: </b> Luckily, everyone is given a unique PKI on this closed network. My solution was to create a small application that fed from a database. When a user visited the application, it would pull the PKI and extract the information needed to identify the user (everyone had to import their PKIs as part of their indoctrination). This information was stored in a database and students were able to clock in and out. A timesheet was essentially created and users could see how much time they spent on our material each day, week, or total. Users were also able to leave a comment for each time block to help them remember what material they were covering or comments for their instructors. Instructors were then able to go into another portion of the application and pull all of their students and see how much time each student spent.</p>

<p><b>The Problem:</b> Millions of dollars a year are spent on ATM fees by the company and the member. How to show the member the closest free ATM from the ATM they just used to change habits?</b></p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b> Develop an application on Android, iOS, and PWA that easily lets members receive and view notifications when they use an ATM with a fee, and see the nearest free ATM. </b></p>
